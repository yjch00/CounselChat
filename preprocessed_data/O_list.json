		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "And you're here today and that's probably something in you you've thought well I'll follow this through, you know I'll-I'll come along and see what-see what they've got to say. And I'm just wondering for this session, for the time we have today, there's a number of things we could talk about. You mentioned a couple of things about your lifestyle and, um, medication is one thing you've been told by the doctor you might need to do that. And a number of things that we could talk about today. Which-which area would you think would be useful for you to focus on?"

		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Great. Well, one thing I want to ask about is, you know, different people have sort of different values or things that are important to them. They might, you know, be really close with family or really have, you know, their friends as being something particularly important. So, I'm gonna show you just a few things on this sheet, and if you can look at them all. So, there's things like belonging, community, cultural identity, family, friendship, modesty, religion, respect, self-determination and spirituality. Which of those do you think is sort of important to you?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "If-if I can draw an analogy-- Again, even though this medicine is in the same family as those big broad-broad family. If I could draw an analogy, a grape and a watermelon are in the same family of fruits, you know, and obviously, grape is much smaller than a watermelon. And if you eat one grape, you'd be fine. If you ate an entire watermelon, it can make you very sick. If we look at the grape as the medicine your daughter's taking, again, it's in the same broad family, the amount of drug that your daughter is getting is very small. Uh, and not only that it's not an anabolic steroid, even though it's in the same big family. And what this drug does is actually reduces the inflammation in your daughter's lungs. And-and it doesn't even get absorbed into the body. It only goes to her lungs. And as I said, I wouldn't want your daughter taking a medication that could have the impact of those anabolic steroids. This is really safe for your daughter to use. So what-what are your thoughts about considering having her using this?"

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay, okay. Well, sometimes when people aren't ready to make changes like this, it helps if they write down their goals, it gives them a chance to see them in black and white. If you were to look at this little form here and figure out where you want to go with your drinking, what would you put down as your goal?"

		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Katie, it sounds like smoking pot is helping you somewhat in helping you relax and it's also causing you a lot of stress because you're trying to use it to fit in and that's not helping, you're worried about getting caught, you're worried about family disapproval. Having said all that, what do you think you wanna do about your pot use?"

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Yeah. So we're noticing some pretty negative effects in terms of your oral health with the smoking. Are there any other things that you're concerned about?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Mm-hmm, okay. So in five years' time, it's fast forward to the future. Five years time, how would you like it to be?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay. Okay, so that sounds-- I think that's great. So why would you be up at a six and not down at a two level? What kinds of thing would push you to be there?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "-and it is something that is considered pretty risky. So, I wonder what you think about that, just in terms of how it fits into your life."
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay. What made you say two instead of one?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Oh, okay, good. You know, I can tell you really have your son's best interest at heart here. You know, just from our conversation today, I can tell you're a really good mom. Um, let's reflect back on what we've discussed here so far. Now, we've got a couple of good options between the neighbor and Head Start programs for childcare. What do you see as your next steps in getting that going?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay. So, okay. So it sounds like you had a lot of thoughts going through your head. Um, you said that you're worried that everyone's looking at you. What other thoughts were there that were in your mind?"

	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

I just had a thought that there's also a good mom's group, we run out of our center. So if you'd like a referral to that or some information, I'd be happy to give you and while you think about it, if you want to, um, talk about this further with one of my colleagues, I'd be happy to make you an appointment."
	},

		"utterance": "So, I'm gonna ask the question this way, on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is not at all confident, and 10 is like, \"I'm very, very confident,\" where would you put yourself on a scale right now of confidence in starting this new plan?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Yeah, and-and in some ways getting caught might be a good thing. I know it might sound a re-really sort of strange thing to say, but I wonder if like getting caught might have been a good thing. Because you would have read the papers about other people's of-- you know. They're the hands that would turn on stuff and end up with gambling problems and big money. So I want- I want to hear much that it might have been a good thing that you got caught at this stage, and you got a chance to do some talking about it and working around some strategies to get it under control so it doesn't control you. What's your hunch about that?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Yes, it is true. Yeah. It is. I mean, people don't come walking through the door who are not interested in it, you know? So, um, yeah, so that's-- So you'd be interested in something like that and, um, what- what other ideas have you thought about that would work for you?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay. So, again, that, sort of, sounds really important. So, what's-what's your dreams? What are your dreams? Where do you wanna be in five years' time? Where does Catherine wanna be? What do you wanna be doing? What are your dreams?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "So if you were to-to list all of the different things that people around you are saying that you need to work on or you need to change, what would some of those things be? And, Sal, just because we write them down here, it doesn't mean that you have to change them."
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "-- doing today?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "So you shared that you're, um, here today because you're having some dissatisfaction with your body and your confidence and your mood and your energy. And you're looking for, um, some different patterns to kind of turn things around for yourself. And what I like to do as I get to know clients is-is let them know a little bit about my philosophies, about health and wellbeing. Um, but first, I'd love to hear what are your philosophies about health and wellbeing?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "No, no. That'll be easy. So what is the first step for you?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay. So, what other things have you've been open to at other times in your life when you've been open to-to new ideas and being able to talk about stuff, that may be tough to talk about?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Okay. Um, so the most you've ever, ever had is two drinks in a day."
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "What kind of things have you been in your rehab?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",
		"utterance": "Yeah. So, on a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being not confident at all, 10 being very confident. How confident are you that you feel you can manage your anxiety in regards to taking this exam?"
	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

	},
	{
		"source": "AnnoMI",

And that's if a woman isn't pregnant. And when it says in the guidelines, as far as drinking, uh, throughout pregnancy, there is no safe amount to drink during pregnancy.

So you're going to reduce your-your alcohol intake, you've already started by reducing your salt intake.

So there's a couple of things that we know that people with Type II diabetes have to look after and have to think about if they want to control the amount of sugar that's in their system, which is the main issue that's causing some of the health problems that people have with Type II diabetes. Too much sugar, and if it's not able to be utilized in the blood cell, in the fat cells, or liver cells, and the muscle cells stays in your bloodstream. And that can cause problems with your circulation. So too high blood sugar and too low a blood sugar can be a problem. So sugar is the main concern in Type II- Type II diabetes.And you mentioned earlier on, a couple of things that the doctor-- You've mentioned some signs that he was kind of a little bit concerned about. Well, what things did you notice over the-over the last month or so?"

	},

Uh, and I think that's because we've done such a good job of eliminating some of these diseases that a lot of people your age, and even my age, are unfamiliar with those things.  Um, so having shared this information with you, what do you think about the idea of vaccines for-for Lilly?"

And I noticed that you were saying to me, you feel a loss of control over these cigarettes.
